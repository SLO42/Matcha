Make sure you have Docker and Docker-Machine installed via brew.
then:
docker-machine create default //once 
docker network create my-net  //once

if for some reason mongodb does not auto start rerun this command as needed 
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -p 3002:27018 --network my-net -v linker:/etc/mongo --restart=always --name=mongodb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=Cancer -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=Toxic -e MONGOD_DATABASE=matcha mongo mongod


after docker is running. 
make sure your docker host ip is marked in the Matcha/server/.env

for the lab i used 192.168.99.100
you may need to change this if docker used a different ip.

change DATABASE_RESET_ON_RESTART to true.
this allows for the install file to create the tables and such for use.

then run from root.

npm install; cd Matcha && npm install; cd server && npm install;
this will install from the package.json's all the packages we use.
then you may get back to root and run npm start. which should in theory run both front and backend
